<p>This will eventually cover creating and using trees in Python, specifically:
<ul>
 <li>mapping over them</li>
 <li>folding over them</li>
 <li>recursive application of functions to subtrees</li>
 <li>adding "context" to tree nodes</li>
 <li>quick and portable serialization/deserialization with json and yaml</li>
 <li>composing these functions to easily accomplish advanced tasks</li>
</ul>
