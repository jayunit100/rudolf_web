<p>In this second part of the article, we'll see more of the git commands
that I find most useful, covering remotes, tags, and rebasing:</p>


<h2>Remote</h2>
<pre class="code">
# see remotes
git remote -v

# make a new remote
git remote add [name] [location]

# get data from a remote -- everything that you don't yet have locally
git fetch [remote]

# show info about a remote
git remote show [remote]

# rename a remote (i.e. change the local alias -- doesn't change anything on the actual remote server)
#   also renames remote branch names
git remote rename [old] [new]
 
# remove a remote
git remote rm [remote]
</pre>


<h2>Tags</h2>
<pre class="code">
# see all tags
git tag

# see tags matching a pattern
#   this doesn't seem to work
git tag -l [pattern]

# make a lightweight tag
git tag [tagname]

# make an annotated tag
#   what does '-a' do?
git tag -a [tagname] -m 'commit message'
 
# show a single tag
git show [tagname]

# make a signed tag
git tag -s [tagname] -m 'commit message'

# verify a signed tag
#   need signer's public key ... somewhere?  in keyring?
git tag -v [tagname]
 
# make a tag of a previous commit
git tag -a [tagname] [commit's sha-1 checksum]

# push one tag to a remote
git push [remote] [tagname]

# push all tags to a remote
git push [remote] --tags
</pre>


<h2>Rebasing</h2>
<pre class="code">
# rebase the current branch onto another branch
git rebase [base-branch]

# rebase a branch onto another branch
git rebase [base-branch] [rebasee-branch]

# typical rebasing workflow:
#   switch to rebasee
git checkout [rebasee-branch]
#   put rebasee on base
git rebase [base-branch]
#   switch to base
git checkout [base-branch]
#   fast-forward merge rebasee into base 
git merge [rebasee-branch]

# more complicated rebase ... don't understand it
git rebase --onto [base-branch] [upstream-branch] [rebasee-branch]
</pre>
