<p class="p1"><b>We finally decided on a site architecture !<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p2">Welcome to RudolF central, the hub for our experiments. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">The most significant of all such experiments, at this point, is this site itself ! <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">It is our first, production scale Clojure web application.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Additionally, it is a dynamic blog generator, which is auto deployed via Github Service hooks onto Heroku on the cloud. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">This also hosts our "Tools", which are a set of simple web services and applications which are (hopefully) both fun as well as (in some cases) quite useful informatics tools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We envision these to grow along side the needs of our projects.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Bird's Eye View of the Technology</b></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">We build our tools in java, clojure, and python.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In particular, this site is built as a JVM app that runs on Clojure on Heroku.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our tools are mostly server side Clojure functions, which may eventually be capable of running on the client side (via ClojureScript, for example). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Frameworks, Frameworks, Frameworks<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p3"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p2">Of course, nobody develops web apps without a zillion frameworks nowadays, and RudolF is no exception!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Rudolf site is written in Clojure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In particular, it uses Ring, Compojure, and Hiccup, to dynamically generate much of the content on this site, and is heavily based off of a Fork (https://github.com/jayunit100/Clojure-Webapp-Example) of Stefan Rock's Clojure web app example. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Deployment</b></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">This site is currently deployed in heroku.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One of our favorite things about heroku is that it is tightly integrated with Git. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">One of the most important features of agile development is the notion of continuous deployment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In order to make sure that all of our latest, coolest tricks are continually added and deployed to this site, we utilize the https://github.com/ajlai/github-heroku-pusher, so that github deployments turn, automagically, into site releases. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">Here's how it works :<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">- Abstractly : First, you have to setup an "auto deployer" of sorts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That is, some kind of a system which is always "on", and which can receive github "post-receive" hooks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That way, when you push to github, this "system" will have a way of "knowing" that a change has happened.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Github post-receive hooks are quite simple -&gt; you just add a URL<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>through the github UI, and the github server simply issues a post-request to that URL everytime that you push.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">- Concretely : Set up a heroku application which is cloned from the abovementioned github project (github-heroku-pusher), and aAdd a post receive hook to github (these are called "WebHook URLS" in the admin interface), and all you have to do is add your "auto deployer" url, with a post-receive suffix.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For example : http://young-waterfall-6861.herokuapp.com/post-receive. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">- Now, we develop some code, update a blog or article, and push it to github. Simple.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>- What if it doesn't work ?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">Of course, like anything else in the cloud, this one is easy to muck up. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">This sort of hackery always leads to minor inconveniences.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Use "heroku logs" to solve the mystery !<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Heroku logs is an AMAZING tool.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It simply grabs all of the logs from the cloud and prints them out for you, locally.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In my case, I initially found that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">2012-06-17T01:23:33+00:00 app[web.1]: /app/lib/init.rb:2:in `block in needs': ENV['HEROKU_USERNAME'] required (RuntimeError)</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">Was being logged as an error, so when I tried to push changes, the post receive hook would work, but it wouldn't deploy the code.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was of course an easy fix :<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">The fix :<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
