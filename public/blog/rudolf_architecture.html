<h1>We finally decided on a site architecture !</h1>

<p>Welcome to RudolF central, the hub for our experiments.</p>

<p>The most significant of all such experiments, at this point, is this site itself!</p>

<p>It is our first, production scale Clojure web application. 
Additionally, it is a dynamic blog generator, 
which is auto deployed via Github Service hooks onto Heroku on the cloud.</p>

<p>This also hosts our "Tools", which are a set of simple web services 
and applications which are (hopefully) both fun as well as 
(in some cases) quite useful informatics tools.
We envision these growing alongside the needs of our projects.</p>



<h1>Bird's Eye View of the Technology</h1>

<p>We build our tools in java, clojure, and python.
In particular, this site is built as a JVM app that runs on Clojure on Heroku.
Our tools are mostly server side Clojure functions, 
which may eventually be capable of running on the client side (via ClojureScript, for example). </p>



<h1>Frameworks, Frameworks, Frameworks</h1>

<p>Of course, nobody develops web apps without a zillion frameworks nowadays, 
and RudolF is no exception! The Rudolf site is written in Clojure.
In particular, it uses Ring, Compojure, and Hiccup 
to dynamically generate much of the content on this site, 
and is heavily based off of a Fork (https://github.com/jayunit100/Clojure-Webapp-Example) 
of Stefan Rock's Clojure web app example.</p>



<h1>Deployment</h1>

<p>This site is currently deployed in heroku. One of our favorite things about heroku 
is that it is tightly integrated with Git.</p>

<p>One of the most important features of agile development is the notion of continuous deployment.
In order to make sure that all of our latest, coolest tricks are continually added and deployed to this site, 
we utilize the https://github.com/ajlai/github-heroku-pusher, so that github deployments turn, 
automagically, into site releases. </p>

<p>Here's how it works:</p>

<p>- Abstractly: First, you have to setup an "auto deployer" of sorts.
That is, some kind of a system which is always "on", and which can receive github 
"post-receive" hooks. That way, when you push to github, this "system" will have a way of "knowing" 
that a change has happened. Github post-receive hooks are quite simple -&gt; 
you just add a URL through the github UI, and the github server simply issues a 
post-request to that URL everytime that you push.</p>

<p>- Concretely: Set up a heroku application which is cloned from the abovementioned 
github project (github-heroku-pusher), and add a post receive hook to github 
(these are called "WebHook URLS" in the admin interface), and all you have to do is 
add your "auto deployer" url, with a post-receive suffix. For example: 
http://young-waterfall-6861.herokuapp.com/post-receive.</p>

<p>- Now, we develop some code, update a blog or article, and push it to github. Simple.</p>



<h1>- What if it doesn't work ?</h1>

<p>Of course, like anything else in the cloud, this one is easy to muck up.</p>

<p>This sort of hackery always leads to minor inconveniences.
Use "heroku logs" to solve the mystery! 
Heroku logs is an AMAZING tool.
It simply grabs all of the logs from the cloud and prints them out for you, locally.
In my case, I initially found that</p>

<pre class="code">2012-06-17T01:23:33+00:00 app[web.1]: /app/lib/init.rb:2:in `block in needs': ENV['HEROKU_USERNAME'] required (RuntimeError)</pre>

<p>Was being logged as an error, so when I tried to push changes, 
the post receive hook would work, but it wouldn't deploy the code. This was of course an easy fix:</p>

<pre class="code">
jays-MacBook-Pro:github-heroku-pusher jayunit100$ heroku config:add HEROKU_USERNAME=jayunit100
Setting config vars and restarting young-waterfall-6861... done, v8
HEROKU_USERNAME: jayunit100</pre>

Especially if you are interested in learning more about 
the Machine learning, Bioinformatics, the JVM, functional programming, virtualization, and Heroku / AWS / GAE.
We are a polyglot group of developers and we like to play with 
all sorts of emerging technologies, especially ones that allow us to 
efficiently solve difficult, interesting problems. While we continue working on the site, 
you can also checkout our respective personal blogs:</p>

<p><b>-&gt; <a href="http://jayunit100.blogspot.com">Jay's blog</a></b></p>

<p>Jay's blog largely focuses on concrete tutorials and tidbits 
explicating the cream-of-the-crop of technologies that are driving
the open-source community's modern, break-neck productivity.
You will find articles about Clojure, Vagrant, 
and a lot of palaver regarding the Jay's JVM hammer-of-the-day.</p>

<p>Matt's blog is relatively new, 
focusing largely on concrete aspects of software development 
that he encounters in his day to day research as a graduate student studying
 … data processing … Although Jay believes that Jay's blog is significantly 
better than Matt's, Jay admits that Matt's recent MySQL tutorial was pretty badass.</p>
