<h2>Our very first RudolF blog article</h2>

<pre>

Welcome to RudolF central, the hub for many of our experiments and musings.  
The Rudolf central is written in Clojure, which continues to mesmerize us.  In particular, it uses
Ring, Compojure, and Hiccup, to dynamically generate much of the content on this site.  

We build our tools in clojure, as server side functions, which may eventually be capable of running on 
the client side via clojurescript.  

Thanks for checking us out.  Come back soon.
