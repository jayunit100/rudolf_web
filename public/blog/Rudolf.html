<h2>Our very first RudolF blog article</h2>

<pre>

Welcome to RudolF central, the hub for many of our experiments and musings.  
The Rudolf central is written in Clojure, which continues to mesmerize us.  In particular, it uses
Ring, Compojure, and Hiccup, to dynamically generate much of the content on this site.  

We build our tools in clojure, as server side functions, which may eventually be capable of running on 
the client side via clojurescript.

<H1> How this site is deployed </H1> 

<pre> 

   This site is currently deployed in heroku.  One of our favorite things about heroku
is that it is tightly integrated with Git.  

One of the most important features of agile development is the notion of continuous deployment.  In order
to make sure that all of our latest, coolest tricks are continually added and deployed to this site, we 
utilize the https://github.com/ajlai/github-heroku-pusher, so that github deployements turn, automagically, 
into site releases.  

Here's how it works : 

- Abstractly : First, you have to setup an "auto deployer" of sorts.  That is, some kind of a system 
which is always "on", and which can receive github "post-receive" hooks.  That way, when you 
push to github, this "system" will have a way of "knowing" that a change has happened.  Github
post-receive hooks are quite simple -> you just add a URL  through the github UI, and the github server
simply issues a post-request to that URL everytime that you push. 
 
- Concretely : Set up a heroku application which is cloned from the abovementioned github project (github-heroku-pusher), and aAdd a post receive hook to github (these are called "WebHook URLS" in the admin interface), and all you have to do is add your "auto deployer" url, with a post-receive suffix.  For example : http://young-waterfall-6861.herokuapp.com/post-receive.  

- Now, we develop some code, update a blog or article, and push it to github. Simple. 

- Problems ? 

Of course, like anything else in the cloud, this one is easy to muck up.

This sort of hackery always leads to minor inconveniences.  Use "heroku logs" to solve the mystery !  Heroku logs is an AMAZING tool.  It simply 
grabs all of the logs from the cloud and prints them out for you, locally.  In my case, I initially found that 

2012-06-17T01:23:33+00:00 app[web.1]: /app/lib/init.rb:2:in `block in needs': ENV['HEROKU_USERNAME'] required (RuntimeError)

Was being logged as an error, so when I tried to push changes, the post receive hook would work, but it wouldn't deploy the code.  This was of course an easy fix : 

The fix : 

jays-MacBook-Pro:github-heroku-pusher jayunit100$ heroku config:add HEROKU_USERNAME=jayunit100
Setting config vars and restarting young-waterfall-6861... done, v8
HEROKU_USERNAME: jayunit100
