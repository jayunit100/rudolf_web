How to add a blog post
------------

 1. create an html file
   - you have to do everything inside the "body" tag
   - but you don't have to do the "body" tag itself

 2. save it in this directory
   - the main part of the filename will be used in Step 3
   - the suffix must be ".html"

 3. you're done! assuming you did it right, you can now:
   - run the local web server
   - see your file at http://localhost:8080/blog/your_post_name, where
      everything after /blog/ is mapped to the main part of the filename



Loose ends/Unfinished business
------------

 1. extending the yaml file
    - do we want any other data in there?
