<h2>Setting up a user account and schema</h2>
Logging in to MySQL typically requires a username and a password.

MySQL comes with one privileged user, root, predefined.

The root user is able to create new users, and assign them passwords and privileges, and create tables, schemas
and do many other things.

First, we need to log in as the root user, and:
<ol> 
 <li>create a new user account with a password</li>
 <li>create a new schema</li>
 <li>grant the new user some privileges on the new schema</li>
</ol>

<pre class="code">
$ mysql -u root -p
</pre>

<pre class="code">
-- this is a comment
-- remember to pick a good password!
create user 'myself'@'localhost' identified by 'p@$$word';

create database tutorial;

grant all on tutorial.* to 'myself'@'localhost';

exit;
</pre>

<ul>Key points:
 <li> users & passwords:  once user accounts are created, they may log in to MySQL using their passwords </li>
 <li> privileges:  users must be granted privileges in order to use tables and schemas </li>
 <li> using the MySQL shell:  MySQL can be used interactively </li>
 <li> schemas:  typically used to organize a set of related tables </li>
 <li> comments:  start with '-- ' and tell MySQL to ignore the line </li>
 <li> terminators:  semicolon (;) </li>
</ul>
</div>





<div class="section">
<h2>Creating and showing tables</h2>
Now that we have a user account and a schema, let's log in:

<pre class="code">
$ mysql -u myself -p
</pre>

Okay, now we need to find and use our schema
<pre class="code">
-- lists the schemas that we are allowed to see and use
show databases;

-- sets the active schema to 'tutorial'
use tutorial;
</pre>

Great!  Now we need to set up a table so that we can play around with some data:
<pre class="code">
-- note the primary key and unique index and data types
create table pizzas (
  id     int,
  name   varchar(40),
  price  decimal(5,2),
    primary key (id),
    unique index (name)
);
</pre>

What if we forget the name of the table?  No problem!  Just do:
<pre class="code">
show tables;
</pre>
and MySQL will happily tell you all of the tables in the current schema.


<ul>Key points:
 <li> setting the current schema:  this makes it easy to work with tables in the selected schema <li>
 <li> making a table:  tables must be defined with appropriate columns before they can be used <li>
 <li> listing the tables in the current schema<li>
</ul>
</div>




<div class="section">
<h2>Inserting data into tables</h2>
What's the use of MySQL if we can't add data to tables??

Let's make some pizza!
<pre class="code">
-- note the name of the table - 'pizzas'
insert into pizzas (id, name, price) values (3, "plain cheese", 9.99);

-- remember how many columns we gave 'pizzas' when we defined it?  3!!
insert into pizzas (id, name, price) values (2, "sausage", 11.99);

-- that's why we need 3 values here, too!
insert into pizzas (id, name, price) values (4, "hawaiian", 15.99);

-- numbers don't need quotation marks, but strings do!
insert into pizzas (id, name, price) values (1, "tomato basil", 12.99);
</pre>

Okay, that's a great, but how do we know any of that worked?  How about:
<pre class="code">
-- check what's in pizzas;
select * from pizzas;
</pre>
Cool, we have 4 pizzas in our 'pizzas' table.  Let's try and add some more:

<pre class="code">
insert into pizzas (id, name, price) values (4, "pepperoni", 11.99);

insert into pizzas (id, name, price) values (5, "plain cheese", 10.99);
</pre>
Oh no!  That didn't work!  What happened??

Remember how we defined 'pizzas'?  The 'id' column and the 'name' column are both unique --
so no duplicates are allowed!

When we tried to add duplicate rows, MySQL complained!

Now try this:
<pre class="code">
insert into pizzas (id, name, price) values (5, "meat lover's", 15.99);
</pre>
That did work!  Why?

Because we didn't say that 'price' has to be unique!

<ul>Key points:
 <li>number of values must match table</li>
 <li>column constraints can cause inserts to fail</li>
 <li>strings must be quoted</li>
</ul>
</div>




<div class="section">
<h2>Reading data from tables</h2>
Now that we have some pizzas, let's eat them (figuratively)!

We'll use 'select' statements to read data from our table.

We can easily read the entire table using the '*' shortcut:
<pre class="code">
-- basic select (already used above ^) reads all rows and all columns from the table
select * from pizzas;
</pre>
But if we only want some columns, we just list them explicitly:
<pre class="code">
-- reads specified columns from all rows of the table
select name, price from pizzas;
</pre>
We can even manipulate the values!  What if we wanted to know how much it would cost
to get two of each pizza?  No problem:
<pre class="code">
-- performs operations on columns from all rows of the table
select name, price * 2 from pizzas;
</pre>
Wait, we forgot about tax:
<pre class="code">
-- add in tax
select name, price * 2 * 1.07 from pizzas;
</pre>

<ul>Key points:
 <li>'select' statements read rows from tables</li>
 <li>use '*' to select all columns</li>
 <li>explicitly name columns otherwise</li>
 <li>all rows are returned</li>
 <li>column values can be manipulated</li>
</ul>
</div>





<div class="section">
<h2>Filter data</h2>
What if we don't want to see ALL of the pizzas?

Using the power of the 'where' clause, we can limit the set of rows returned.

Let's say we're cheapskates and know we want to spend less than $12 on a pizza:
<pre class="code">
select id, name, price from pizzas where price < 12;
</pre>
or we just worked out and need some serious protein:
<pre class="code">
select name from pizzas where name regexp 'meat';
</pre>
or we're 5 years old and only eat cheese pizzas:
<pre class="code">
select * from pizzas where name = 'plain cheese';
</pre>

<ul>Key points:
 <li>use a 'where' clause to limit results</li>
 <li>can use equality or inequality predicates</li>
</ul>
</div>





<div class="section">
<h2>Grouping data</h2>
Sometimes, you need to get a single piece of information about a bunch of rows, all at once.

Look no further than the 'group by' clause and aggregating functions!

Let's see how many pizzas there are of each different price:
<pre class="code">
select price, count(*) from pizzas group by price;
</pre>
And how many cheap pizzas there are:
<pre class="code">
select count(*) from pizzas where price < 12;
</pre>
WHOA!  There wasn't a 'group by' clause there ... what happened??

When you use an aggregating function (such as count) without a 'group by' clause, ALL of the 
rows are placed in a SINGLE group!

Try this:  let's find out how much it would cost to get one of each of the expensive pizzas:
<pre class="code">
select sum(price) from pizzas where price >= 12;
</pre>

<ul>Key points:
 <li>'group by' clauses separate your rows into groups</li>
 <li>aggregating functions -- such as min, max, avg, sum, and count -- analyze groups</li>
 <li>one row per group is returned</li>
 <li>an aggregating function without a 'group by' clause returns a single row</li>
 <li>'group by' and 'where' clauses can be combined -- but the 'where' clause goes first!</li>
</ul>
</div>





<div class="section">
<h2>Deleting data</h2>
Getting rid of data is important, too.

The 'delete' statement takes care of that.

Let's try one out:
<pre class="code">
delete from pizzas;

-- and check what the result was
select * from pizzas;
</pre>
Oops -- we just deleted everything in the table!  

Always be careful with 'delete' statements -- if you don't use a 'where' clause, they'll delete everything!

Let's try that again (but first we'll rebuild the table):
<pre class="code">
-- rebuild the database:  this time with an extra row
insert into pizzas (id, name, price) values 
  (3, "plain cheese", 9.99),
  (2, "sausage", 11.99),
  (4, "hawaiian", 15.99),
  (1, "tomato basil", 12.99),
  (5, "meat lover's", 15.99),
  (6, "unpopular pizza", 15.99);

-- check what's in the table
select * from pizzas;
</pre>
Let's try and delete the "unpopular pizza":
<pre class="code">
delete from pizzas where price = 15.99;

-- ... and check the results
select * from pizzas;
</pre>
Oh noes!!  Wrong again -- we deleted all 3 rows that have a price of 15.99!

Let's rebuild the table again:
<pre class="code">
insert into pizzas (id, name, price) values 
  (4, "hawaiian", 15.99),
  (5, "meat lover's", 15.99);
</pre>
And try one last time:

<pre class="code">
delete from pizzas where id = 6;

select * from pizzas;
</pre>

<ul>Key points:
 <li>use 'delete' to remove rows</li>
 <li>use a 'where' clause to delete only the appropriate rows</li>
</ul>
</div>





<div class="section">
<h2>Updating data</h2>
Uh-oh, the customers are complaining about our menu.  Let's spice up some names to keep them off our back!

We'll have to use 'update' statments to change our pizzas:
<pre class="code">
update pizzas set name = "hawaiian pineapple" where name = "hawaiian";

update pizzas set name = "zesty Italian sausage" where name = "sausage";
</pre>

Now our supplier is upping his prices.  We have to increase *our* prices by $1 each!
<pre class="code">
-- no 'where' clause:  affects every row!
update pizzas set price = price + 1;
</pre>

<ul>Key points:
 <li>use 'update' to modify rows</li>
 <li>use a 'where' clause to modify only the appropriate rows</li>
 <li>the "old" values can be used</li>
</ul>
</div>





<div class="section">
<h2>Sorting data</h2>
We need to put the most expensive pizzas at the top of the menu, so people will see them first!

We'll have to use 'order by' to sort these pizzas:
<pre class="code">
select * from pizzas order by price desc;
</pre>
No wait, we want the cheapest pizzas at the top to increase sales!!
<pre class="code">
select * from pizzas order by price asc;
</pre>

<ul>Key points:
 <li>use 'order by' to sort results</li>
 <li>'order by' can be used in conjunction with 'where' and 'group by'</li>
</ul>
</div>





<div class="section">
<h2>Unit test</h2>
If you run this query and get these results:
<pre class="code">
mysql> select * from pizzas order by price desc;
+----+-----------------------+-------+
| id | name                  | price |
+----+-----------------------+-------+
|  4 | hawaiian pineapple    | 16.99 |
|  5 | meat lover's          | 16.99 |
|  1 | tomato basil          | 13.99 |
|  2 | zesty Italian sausage | 12.99 |
|  3 | plain cheese          | 10.99 |
+----+-----------------------+-------+
</pre>
you're good to go!!
